            <p class="justify">A keyboard is a computer input device that allows the user to input letters, numbers, and symbols by pressing buttons or keys. The keys are arranged in a specific layout, usually the QWERTY layout, and each key represents a specific character or command.
            <p class="justify">Modern computer keyboards usually have additional keys for functions such as controlling the volume, accessing the internet, or opening specific applications. There are many different types of keyboards, including wired and wireless models, ergonomic models designed to reduce strain on the hands and wrists, and gaming keyboards optimized for use in video games.</p>
            <p class="justify">Keyboards can be connected to a computer, laptop, tablet, or even a smartphone, and are an essential tool for anyone who needs to input text, commands, or data into a device.</p>

            <h2 id="types">Types</h2>
            <p class="p-home">There are many types of keyboards, including:</p>
            <ul class="typesofkeyboard">
                <li class="tofkeyboard"><span class="bold">Standard Keyboard:</span> This is the most common type of keyboard and it usually comes with a QWERTY layout.</li>
                <li class="tofkeyboard"><span class="bold">Wireless Keyboard:</span> This type of keyboard connects to your device wirelessly, usually via Bluetooth or a USB receiver.</li>
                <li class="tofkeyboard"><span class="bold">Ergonomic Keyboard:</span> This type of keyboard is designed to reduce strain on the hands and wrists. It often has a split design that allows for a more natural hand position.</li>
                <li class="tofkeyboard"><span class="bold">Gaming Keyboard:</span> This type of keyboard is designed specifically for gaming and often has features like programmable keys, customizable lighting, and extra function keys.</li>
                <li class="tofkeyboard"><span class="bold">Virtual Keyboard:</span> This is a software-based keyboard that appears on the screen of a device like a tablet or smartphone.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="p-home">Within the standard keyboards there are two more types of keyboards:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="parag-types">
            <h2 id="mechanical">Mechanical</h2>
            <p class="justify">Mechanical keyboards are a type of keyboard that uses individual mechanical switches for each key. Each switch has a physical mechanism that registers a keystroke when it is pressed, providing tactile feedback and a distinct sound. Mechanical keyboards are popular among gamers, writers, and programmers because they provide a more satisfying typing experience than membrane or scissor-switch keyboards, and are often more durable and reliable.</p>
            <p class="justify">The key switches in mechanical keyboards can have different characteristics, such as actuation force, travel distance, and tactile feedback. The most common types of mechanical key switches are: </p>
            <ul class="typesofkeyboard">
                <li class="tofkeyboard"><span class="bold">Cherry MX:</span> These are some of the most popular and widely used mechanical switches, and they come in several different colors (e.g. red, blue, brown) that provide different levels of tactile feedback and actuation force.</li>
                <li class="tofkeyboard"><span class="bold">Kailh:</span> These switches are similar to Cherry MX switches and come in various colors and types.</li>
                <li class="tofkeyboard"><span class="bold">Gateron:</span> These switches are also similar to Cherry MX switches and come in various colors.</li>
                <li class="tofkeyboard"><span class="bold">Topre:</span> These switches use a different mechanism that provides a unique tactile experience and sound.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="justify">In addition to the switches, mechanical keyboards often have other features, such as backlighting, programmable keys, and macro functionality. They may also be available in different sizes and form factors, such as tenkeyless (without a numeric keypad) or compact (with a smaller footprint).</p>
            <p class="justify">Overall, mechanical keyboards offer a more tactile and responsive typing experience than other types of keyboards, and they are popular among people who spend a lot of time typing or gaming. However, they can be more expensive than membrane or scissor-switch keyboards, and their sound and tactile feedback may not be suitable for all environments.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="parag-types">
            <h2 id="membrane">Membrane</h2>
        <p class="justify">Membrane keyboards are a type of keyboard that uses a flexible membrane layer to register keystrokes. The keys on a membrane keyboard are typically made of plastic or rubber and are arranged in a grid pattern on top of a flexible membrane layer. When a key is pressed, it pushes down on the membrane, which completes a circuit and registers the keystroke. Membrane keyboards are commonly used in low-cost computer keyboards, such as those that come bundled with desktop computers or laptops.</p>
        <p class="justify">Membrane keyboards have several advantages over mechanical keyboards, including:</p>
        
        <ul class="typesofkeyboard">
            <li class="tofkeyboard"><span class="bold">Lower cost:</span> Membrane keyboards are generally less expensive than mechanical keyboards, making them a more budget-friendly option.</li>
            <li class="tofkeyboard"><span class="bold">Quieter operation:</span> The flexible membrane layer makes membrane keyboards much quieter than mechanical keyboards, which can be beneficial in environments where noise levels need to be kept to a minimum.</li>
            <li class="tofkeyboard"><span class="bold">Spill-resistant:</span> The flexible membrane layer in membrane keyboards helps protect the electronic components from spills or other accidents.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="justify">However, membrane keyboards have some disadvantages as well, including:</p>
        <ul class="typesofkeyboard">
            <li class="tofkeyboard"><span class="bold">Lack of tactile feedback:</span> Because the keys on a membrane keyboard do not have individual mechanical switches, they do not provide the same level of tactile feedback as mechanical keyboards. This can make it more difficult to know if a keystroke has been registered.</li>
            <li class="tofkeyboard"><span class="bold">Limited durability:</span> The flexible membrane layer in membrane keyboards can wear out over time, leading to a less responsive typing experience and a shorter lifespan.</li>
            <li class="tofkeyboard"><span class="bold">Limited customization:</span> Membrane keyboards often have limited options for customization, such as programmable keys or customizable lighting.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="justify">Overall, membrane keyboards are a cost-effective option for basic computer input needs, but they may not be suitable for users who require a more tactile and responsive typing experience.</p>
